## How to start on a new unfamiliar Project?

- Schedule 30 minute meeting with lead technical members of the team.
- Take 25 minutes to ask:
    - Tell me everything you think I should know about the project?
    - Take notes of everything (Even better record the meeting if possible).
    - Stop only to ask for clarification, Always get things clarified if unclear.
- Next 2 minutes ask:
    - What are the challenges on the project?
    - What are the major pain points in the project?
- Final few minutes:
    - Ask who are the other members on the team or across teams you would need to talk to?

Follow these steps till you do not hear any new names.
